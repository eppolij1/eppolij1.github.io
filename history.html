  <h5 style="font-size:20px;"> 
 Created in the Fall of 2018 Stick Volley Started as a fun time wasting game where you can watch stick figures hit a ball around and try to score. The creator of Stick Volley decided 
he wanted a league, where teams would have franchises and compete against one another for a championship. By the summer of 2019 the Stick Volley League was created and the creator asked 6 of his friends if they would like to have a team. And thus 6 teams were created that summer.
Those six originals being Metro Madness, Keyboard Smashers, Groudners, Majestic Turtle Chumps, Lobsterbacks, and Grenadiers. They drafted from the a list of free agent players who were trying to enter the league. The first season went smooth with Metro Madness winning it with Carter Colson and Keith Jackson leading the way. And by the second season two new teams
entered the Stick Volley League. One being the Peacocks and the other being the Clownfish. At the start of each season there is a rookie draft just like any sport, where young college talent would enter the draft to be drafted. Peacocks won season 2 and that was just the start of 
their dynasty. Season 3 consisted of new rules and better production of the videos. Majestic T. Chumps won season 3 on the backs of Donald Barnes, Gus Graham, and Benjamin Hartman. By the time season 4 came Stick Volley was starting to get around and people were getting to know 
the game. By the end of season 4 the SVL gained over 20 subs since the start of season 3. Season 4 ended with the Peacocks winning their second title and becoming the first team to do so. After season 4 a massive 32 team tournament was played called Stick Madness. Teams from the 
American, United Kingdom, Italian, and German Stick Volley Leagues battled it out on the court to try and win it all. No one would have thought, but the number 31 seed Rhinos won the tournament, being the underdogs and upsetting every team they faced. And now here we are, Season 5
has just begun and with no sports on television fans join in from all over to watch the virtual sport of Stick Volley.
